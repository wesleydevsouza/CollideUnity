# CollideUnity

**CollideUnity** is a prototype game developed for learning purposes, inspired by the minigame **Seal Slammers** from *Honkai Star Rail*, created by **HoYoverse**.

This project explores physics-based mechanics, turn-based gameplay, and player interaction systems using the Unity engine.

## 🎮 About the Game

* A study-driven prototype inspired by **Seal Slammers**.
* Players are launched into an arena using the mouse.
* Collisions with walls and other players deal damage.
* Damage is visually represented using floating text.
* A turn-based system is managed through a central **GameManager**.
* Each player has attributes like **health** and **damage**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Unity** (Game Engine)
* **C#** (Programming Language)
* Unity’s built-in physics system
* UI and gameplay logic development

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project was created for educational purposes, with a focus on:

* Implementing realistic collision-based physics
* Prototyping mechanics inspired by existing games
* Building turn-based gameplay systems
* Displaying dynamic player feedback (e.g., health, damage, turn order)
